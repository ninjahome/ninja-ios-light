  AMRAudioSwift is a useful tool to encode or decode audio between AMR and WAVE. It's written in Swift, and it supports Bitcode.

  In addition, AMRAudioSwift contains an audio recorder/player, which can record voice and play AMR data.
  
  At the bottom level, libopencore-amr is applied for audio decoding.
